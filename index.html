  What is PCC LEAH Friday coop?
</h1>



<p>
  PCC LEAH Friday co-op is a cooperation of parents working together to enrich their individual homeschools with different
  age-appropriate classes. A Co-op Board made of chapter members oversees the co-op. Participation is optional. There are
  two sessions planned for this year: fall and winter/spring.
</p>



<p>
  Friday Co-op is just one of the many things PCC LEAH offers to support, encourage and enrich member’s homeschools. Besides
  Friday co-op, there are support meetings, Care and Share Nights, Men’s Breakfast, prayer support, test groups, fieldtrips,
  etc. These areas work together to make up the ministry of PCC LEAH and accomplish our vision for homeschooling.

  PCC LEAH vision: Support and enable parents following God’s calling to homeschool, to equip their children to be Godly leaders.
